🟦 FinSwarm
FinSwarm is an AI-powered, goal-driven financial learning and decision-intelligence system.

FinSwarm is an AI-powered financial decision intelligence platform that helps first-time investors understand financial options and risks — without giving financial advice or handling money.

Built with Responsible AI, transparency, and financial inclusion at its core.

🚀 Why FinSwarm?

Millions of new retail investors enter financial markets without understanding:

 - What investment options mean

 - What risks they carry

 - How people like them typically reason before investing

 - Most platforms either:

 - Give opaque recommendations, or

 - Assume prior financial knowledge

FinSwarm bridges this gap by explaining investment concepts and risks in clear, human language, enabling users to make informed decisions on their own.
